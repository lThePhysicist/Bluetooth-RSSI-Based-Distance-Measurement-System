# Bluetooth-RSSI-Based-Distance-Measurement-System
n this project, the MSP430G2553 microcontroller and a Bluetooth  module are used to estimate the distance to a device with a specific MAC  address by measuring the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).  The system communicates via UART and displays the estimated distance  on an LCD screen. The implementation includes AT command  processing,
